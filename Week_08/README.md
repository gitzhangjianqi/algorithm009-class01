	In computing, cache algorithms (also frequently called cache replacement algorithms 
	or cache replacement policies) are optimizing instructions, or algorithms, 
	that a computer program or a hardware-maintained structure can utilize in order to 
	manage a cache of information stored on the computer. Caching improves performance by 
	keeping recent or often-used data items in memory locations that are faster or computationally 
	cheaper to access than normal memory stores. When the cache is full, the algorithm must choose 
	which items to discard to make room for the new ones.
